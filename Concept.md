<ul>
<li>reduce traffic jams</li>
<li>reduce AIR pollution of busiest areas</li>
<li>improve pedestrian and drivers security</li>
<li>improve information data about its city</li>
<li>reduce traffic lights energy footprint</li>
</ul>

## Drivers:

This is the second type of user the application is directed to. He/she wants to: 
<ul>
<li>reduce road trip times</li>
<li>reduce fuel consumption</li>
<li>increase driving safety</li>
</ul>

## Pedestrians:

This is the third type of user the application is directed to. He/she wants to:
<ul>
<li>increase his/her security when using pedestrian crossing</li>
