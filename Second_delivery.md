# Second delivery

## Comments from first delivery
1. very rich project with clear problems, but prioritize and focus on one or two at most
2. what are the requirements?
3. are you getting energy from the crosslights?
4. frame rate expected?
5. do you have enough resources to run ML algorithms?
6. Can you bring ML on the edge?
7. Nice end-user metrics how do you translate them in low level requirements
8. security and safety? It is fundamental in this kind of projects

Now for each of the previous points we explain our decisions:

3. the main idea is to get the energy from the cross lights
5. 6. To run ML on the edge we don't have enough resources so we will do it on cloud.


## Changes

### Concept
No changes has been done.

#### Cloud service
There are no changes for this part.

### Evaluation

## Presentation of technical work

## Missing functionalities

## Evaluation
For the evaluation:
- we estimated the **power consumption** of single subsytems
- we evaluated **performances of the NN**
- we estimated the **latency** in the whole system

## Evaluation for the 3rd delivery
We want to obtain the correct estimation of the previous parameters with the real prototype.
