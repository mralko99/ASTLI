A separate mark-down document in the repository (called "Evaluation") providing details on how to performance of the product/service will be evaluated, (i) during the development of the project, (ii) when the first complete version of the system will be ready for use. The document needs to describe the evaluation methodology for both the overall system as well as each individual components and define specific key performance indicators that will be measured, tools that will be used.
The document should clearly address the following aspects:
** The evaluation of the performance of the network technologies.
** The evaluation of the performance of the embedded devices in terms of power consumption and energy efficiency.
** The evaluation of the response time from an end-user point of view.
