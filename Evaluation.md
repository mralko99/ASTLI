### The evaluation of the performance of the network technologies.
* We would use wifi connection to get a good througput of the video data from the esp32 to the raspberry and we would have a 4g module to connect with the internet trying to reduce packet loss
### The evaluation of the performance of the embedded devices in terms of power consumption and energy efficiency.
* The esp32 with a continuous camera feed will consume good amount of energy, so it would be easier to make this devices connected to the grid.
* Also the raspberry pi that is used for all the connection with the semaphore and internet would be connected to the grid.
### The evaluation of the response time from an end-user point of view.
* The response time is very important since it's representative of the efficency of the system, the system should correctly detect veichle and pedestrian and act fast to change the traffic light to adapt the traffic flow.
* The performance of the system could also be evaluated with the number of accident, pollutants in the air and time spent on the junction
